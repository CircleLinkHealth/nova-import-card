<p><b>ENGLISH [speak clearly and cheerfully]</b>: Hi this is {{auth()->user()->fullName}} calling on behalf of
    <b>Dr. @{{provider_name}}'s </b> office. How are you doing today?</p>

<p>I’m fine. The doctor[s] have invited you to their new personalized care management program. You may have received a
    letter about this. <b>Dr. @{{provider_name}}</b> think(s) that this program would be helpful to your health and
    would like you
    to enroll. May I tell you a little about this program?</p>

<p><i>[Patients interested usually discuss their conditions here.. be sure to listen. If patient asks where calling from,
        use the practice name in goog sheet, e.g., CareMedica or Ferguson]</i></p>

<p>This is a new preventative care program from Medicare to help you and your doctor take better care of your
    health.</p>

<p>Before, Medicare was reactive, often waiting until patients were already ill to provide care, which is not great for
    patients and expensive for Medicare.

    Now, Medicare is being proactive: providing care between doctor’s visits to prevent hospitalization, including
    making sure your conditions are under control, you are taking your medications, and you don’t have any symptoms that
    might be bothering you.

    Here’s some details on the program:</p>

<li> A personal care coach— registered nurse-- will do a quick phone checkin about twice a month, to provide support,
    personalized care, and to see how you’re doing
</li>

<li> The information we collect is available to your doctor, and will be shared with your doctor immediately if you
    request, or if the nurse judges it appropriate
</li>

<li> You can leave a message for us 24/7 and one of our care coaches will get back to you shortly</li>

<li> You can withdraw at any time you want. Just give us a call</li>

<li> You can only be part of one doctor’s care management program at a time</li>

<p>Can let your Dr. know you consented to enroll in this program today? (Remember you can always

    withdraw if you don’t like it)</p>
