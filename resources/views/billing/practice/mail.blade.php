<ul>
    <li><b>Date of Service:</b> We recommend the last business day of billing month
    <li><b>Billing Location:</b> Billing provider’s location. CMS: “where the billing practitioner would furnish a
        face-to-face
        office visit with the patient”
    <li><b>Include a Chronic Condition:</b> The <a href="{{$patientReportURL}}">billing report</a> has a
        condition for
        each patient that we recommend submitting with your claim to Medicare
    <li><b>Billing Provider:</b> Main provider of patient. Always use an MD if possible
</ul>
