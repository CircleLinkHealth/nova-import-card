- Never take stimulants such as amphetamines or cocaine. These drugs can speed up your heart rate and trigger atrial fibrillation.

- Take quitting one day at a time, even one minute at a time—whatever you need to succeed.

- Many people worry about gaining weight when they quit smoking.  Focus on stopping smoking, which is much worse for your health than gaining a few pounds. 

- When you have the urge to smoke, do something active instead. Walk around the block. Head to the gym. Garden. Do housework. Walk the dog. Play with the kids.

- Ask friends and family members who are smokers not to smoke around you, and try to avoid situations that remind you of smoking.

- Let people help you quit!  Call 1-877-44U-QUIT (1-877-448-7848).  The National Cancer Institute\'s trained counselors are available to provide information and help with quitting in English or Spanish, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time.
