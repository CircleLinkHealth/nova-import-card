<span> has invested in a new Personalized Care Program to help patients get care at home, which is especially important given current events, and I'm inviting you to join.</span></p>

<p><span>You are getting this invitation because you're eligible according to Medicare guidelines, and we believe you will benefit from it greatly, particularly during this pandemic.</span></p>

<p><span>Here's how it works:</span></p>
<ul class='browser-default'>
<li><span>You'll get monthly calls from a Registered Nurse Care Coach to help you manage your health conditions, so you can stay as active and healthy as you can be.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class='browser-default'>
<li><span>By staying healthy in between office visits, you'll be less likely to need extra/expensive medical care, including visits to the ER or the hospital, which helps reduce your medical bills.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class='browser-default'>
<li><span>You can avoid being on hold when you need something: your nurse can help with prescription refills, appointment scheduling, transportation assistance, and any general questions.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class='browser-default'>
<li><span>You can disenroll at any time. This is a voluntary program meant to provide assistance and benefits outside of our physical office.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span>What's the Cost?</span></p>
<p><span>The program is covered by Medicare. If you have Medicaid or a supplemental insurance, it will likely cover the copay, which means you'll have $0 out-of-pocket costs. In addition, during this crisis, your Dr. may waive co-pays for this kind of remote care. Medicare has invested in this program because it saves them money by keeping people like you healthy.</span></p>

<p style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span>What's Next?</span></p>
<p><span>$locationEnrollButton For more information, please see below Frequently Asked Questions or call $practiceNumber</span><span> to be connected with one of our care coordinators</span><strong style='font-weight: 600;'>.</strong></p>

<p><span>I look forward to having you join this program to continue keeping you healthy between office visits.</span></p>

                        <p><strong style='font-weight: 600;'>What is the Personalized Care Program?</strong></p>
                        <p>The Personalized Care Program provides support and care between doctor visits to eligible patients. Services include access to a care team who can answer your healthcare questions and help you get the information, appointments, treatments, and care you need to live a healthier life.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong style='font-weight: 600;'>Why does my doctor want this for me?</strong></p>
                        <p>While everyone can benefit from having their care coordinated, it can be especially important if you are managing multiple conditions. You may be seeing different types of doctors or taking several medications. When your care is coordinated properly, your doctors get the information they need when they need it and have peace of mind knowing that your healthcare needs are being met.</strong></p>
                        
                        <p><strong style='font-weight: 600;'>Is my information private and secure?</strong></p>
                        <p>Yes - just like there are rules in banking that protect your financial information, there are rules in healthcare that protect your medical information.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong style='font-weight: 600;'>But what if I feel fine?</strong></p>
                        <p>Great. Let's keep it that way. One of the reasons your doctor is inviting you to participate in this program is to help you get and stay as healthy as possible. The program also focuses on things like helping you keep on top of preventive care and helping you find valuable healthcare resources and community services.</p>
                     
                        <p><strong style='font-weight: 600;'>What does the program cost?</strong></p>
                        <p>The Personalized Care Program is a benefit under Medicare Part B. However, there may be a co-payment for this benefit. If you have a secondary health plan, it will likely cover the remainder. For example, if you have both Medicare and Medicaid, there is <u>$0</u> out of pocket cost.  In addition, during this crisis, your Dr. may waive co-pays for this kind of remote care. You can contact your health plan if youâ€™re not sure of your coverage or you can ask our care coordinators for assistance when they reach out to you.</p> <br>";
