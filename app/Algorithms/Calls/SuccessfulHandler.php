/*
 * Signature: 'core algorithm'
 *
 * ------------------------------------*---------------------------------------
 * Currently, the factors taken into consideration are:
 * - Call Status (Reached, Unreached)
 * - Current Month's CCM Time Bracket (0-10, 10-15, 15-20, >20)
 * - Week Number in current Month (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) [Special Consideration for months with 5 weeks]
 * - No Of Successful Calls to Patient
 * ------------------------------------*---------------------------------------
 * WEEKS:
 * Week 1: 1-7
 * Week 2: 8-14
 * Week 3: 15-21
 * Week 4: 22-28
 * Week 5: 29-31 (not for Feb)
 *
 * returns an array of the new call date, start window, and end window.
